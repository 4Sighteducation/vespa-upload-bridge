Dear Kellet School,

IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND for student registration:

Please have ALL students use ONE of these methods:

1. EASIEST: Use mobile data (not school WiFi)
   - Turn off WiFi on phone
   - Scan QR code using mobile data
   - Complete registration

2. ALTERNATIVE: Access from home
   - Save/screenshot the QR code
   - Complete registration from home network

3. TECHNICAL: Use this direct link (bypasses the issue):
   https://4sighteducation.github.io/vespa-online/self-registration.html

This is a temporary network configuration issue we're resolving immediately.

Students already using VPN can continue as normal.

UPDATE: We've identified the issue - it's a network security configuration.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
âœ“ Students should use mobile data (not school WiFi)
âœ“ Or complete registration from home
âœ“ VPN users can continue normally

We're deploying a permanent fix within 15 minutes.

Technical: Your school network is blocking cross-origin requests to our registration API. This is a security feature that we're adjusting.
