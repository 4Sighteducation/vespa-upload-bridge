# KS5 Validation Fix for Course Type Prefixes

## Issue Fixed
The validation was incorrectly flagging subjects with course type prefixes as invalid because it was sending the full prefixed subject names to the API for validation.

## Solution Implemented
Updated the validation logic to strip course type prefixes before sending subject names to the validation APIs while preserving the original prefixed names in the CSV data and error messages.

## Changes Made

### Frontend (vespa-upload-bridge)
- **index9z.js** (formerly index9y.js):
  - Updated `validateLocally()` to strip prefixes before calling `/api/validation/check-subjects`
  - Updated `validateCsvData()` to strip prefixes before calling `/api/students/ks5-subjects/validate`
  - Preserves original subject names with prefixes in error messages
  - Supports all 18 course type prefixes

### Supported Prefixes
The following prefixes are now properly handled during validation:
- `A - ` (A Level)
- `AS - ` (AS Level)
- `BT - ` (BTEC)
- `CN - ` (Cambridge National)
- `WBQ - ` (Welsh Baccalaureate)
- `EPQ - ` (Extended Project)
- `IB - ` (International Baccalaureate)
- `T - ` (T Level)
- `C - ` (City & Guilds)
- `D - ` (Diploma)
- `CT - ` (Certificate)
- `AP - ` (Applied)
- `NV - ` (NVQ)
- `GN - ` (GNVQ)
- `CM - ` (Cambridge International)
- `OCR - ` (OCR)
- `L3 - ` (Level 3)
- `L2 - ` (Level 2)

## How It Works

1. **Validation Process**:
   - User uploads CSV with prefixed subjects (e.g., "A - Biology")
   - Frontend strips prefixes for validation (sends "Biology" to API)
   - API validates the clean subject names
   - If invalid, errors show the original prefixed name to the user

2. **Processing**:
   - During actual processing, the full prefixed names are sent to the backend
   - Backend worker.js recognizes prefixes and applies appropriate calculations

## Subjects That May Still Show as Invalid

If you're still seeing validation errors for certain subjects, it may be because those subjects aren't in the approved subject list. Common examples:

1. **"Computing"** - May need to be entered as "Computer Science" instead
2. **"Welsh 2nd Language"** - May need to be entered as "Welsh Second Language" or similar

## Testing the Fix

1. Upload a CSV with prefixed subjects:
   ```csv
   UPN,Student_Email,GCSE_Prior_Attainment,sub1,sub2,sub3
   123456,student@school.uk,7.5,A - Biology,BT - Business,WBQ - Advanced Skills Challenge Cert
   ```

2. The validation should now pass for recognized subjects with valid prefixes

3. The system will correctly identify the qualification types during processing

## Next Steps if Still Having Issues

If certain subjects are still showing as invalid:

1. **Check the subject name spelling** - The API validates against a specific list of approved subjects
2. **Try without the prefix** - See if the base subject name is recognized
3. **Contact support** - The subject may need to be added to the approved list in the backend
